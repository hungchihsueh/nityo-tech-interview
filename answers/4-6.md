What is virtual DOM and what purpose does it aim to solve?? **/
```

The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM used by libraries like React to minimize costly direct updates. State changes are applied to the virtual DOM, diffed against its previous state, and only the minimal differences are patched to the real DOM, improving performance and responsiveness.

Can you explain about the type of never and what is the differ with void? **/
```

In TypeScript, `never` and `void` are two distinct types that serve different purposes. `void` is typically used to indicate that a function does not return a value, while `never` is used to indicate that a function will never complete successfully (e.g., it always throws an error or enters an infinite loop). This means that `never` is a subtype of all types, including `void`, but `void` is not a subtype of `never`.

What is difference between framework base website and normal website (none framework)
```

A framework-based website is built using a pre-defined set of tools, libraries, and conventions provided by a web development framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js). These frameworks offer structured ways to build and manage web applications, often including features like component-based architecture, state management, routing, and more. This can lead to faster development times, better maintainability, and scalability.
