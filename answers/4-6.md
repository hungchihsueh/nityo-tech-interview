What is virtual DOM and what purpose does it aim to solve?? **/
```
Virtual DOM is a programming concept used in libraries like React to optimize updates to the actual DOM (Document Object Model). It is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that allows for efficient rendering and updating of UI components. When a change occurs in the application state, instead of directly manipulating the real DOM (which can be slow and inefficient), the changes are first applied to the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM then compares the new version with the previous version using a process called "diffing." This process identifies the minimal set of changes needed to update the real DOM. Finally, only those changes are applied to the real DOM, resulting in improved performance and a smoother user experience. The main purpose of the virtual DOM is to reduce the performance overhead associated with direct DOM manipulation, leading to faster rendering and more responsive applications.

Can you explain about the type of never and what is the differ with void? **/
```
In TypeScript, `never` and `void` are two distinct types that serve different purposes. `void` is typically used to indicate that a function does not return a value, while `never` is used to indicate that a function will never complete successfully (e.g., it always throws an error or enters an infinite loop). This means that `never` is a subtype of all types, including `void`, but `void` is not a subtype of `never`. Understanding the difference between these two types is important for effectively using TypeScript's type system.

What is difference between framework base website and normal website (none framework)
```

A framework-based website is built using a pre-defined set of tools, libraries, and conventions provided by a web development framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js). These frameworks offer structured ways to build and manage web applications, often including features like component-based architecture, state management, routing, and more. This can lead to faster development times, better maintainability, and scalability.
